# Friday Night Lovin'

A [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) recreation of *Friday Night Funkin'*.

This project is super barebones!! Players are encouraged to add their own songs and charts. For a quick start, check out the [`example.zip`](https://github.com/plexityyy/friday-night-lovin/blob/main/resources/example.zip) file, which includes some of Week 3's songs. If you're looking to add songs for this project, it should be a good example on how to do so.

This is not meant to be a full recreation of the original game, but rather just a hobbyist project that I've scrapped more than several times already (it just so happens that this attempt is the most promising one).

Uses tools from [HTV04's Funkin Rewritten](https://github.com/HTV04/funkin-rewritten).

## Getting Started
Follow this guide if you're not JUST going to play the game (for those purposes, download the OS-specific binaries found in the releases page).
1. Download and install LÖVE2D. Instructions are on their official site.
2. Clone/Download this repository, either with Git or by clicking `Code > Download ZIP`.
3. To launch the game, either drag and drop the `src/` folder's contents onto the LÖVE2D executable, or run the `love` command on the same folder.
