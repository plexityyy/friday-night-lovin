# Friday Night Lovin'

A [LÃ¶ve2D](https://love2d.org/) recreation of *Friday Night Funkin'*.

This project is super barebones!! Players are encouraged to add their own songs and charts. For a quick start, check out the [`example.zip`](https://github.com/plexityyy/friday-night-lovin/blob/main/resources/example.zip) file, which includes some of Week 3's songs. If you're looking to add songs for this project, it should be a good example on how to do so.

This is not meant to be a full recreation of the original game, but rather just a hobbyist project, and will have tons of issues.

Uses tools from [HTV04's Funkin Rewritten](https://github.com/HTV04/funkin-rewritten).
